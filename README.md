# Lab 211 — MVC Sample Projects (Free Code Sharing)

This repository collects small lab projects written following the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern. Use these samples to learn, experiment, and adapt for your own lab assignments. **Important:** always modify the code to meet *your* instructor's requirements before submitting.

## Architecture (MVC)
- Model: data classes and persistence (business logic, entities).
- View: UI or console presentation of data.
- Controller: glue between model and view; orchestrates logic and user input.

## Notes on adapting for assignments
- Change names, structure, and implementation to match your assignment spec.
- Add or remove features per teacher requirements.
- Ensure proper input/output formatting and error handling expected by graders.
- Update tests or add new unit tests that reflect assignment criteria.
